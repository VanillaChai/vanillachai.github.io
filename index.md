Since middleschool, I've worked on dozens of personal projects spanning C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Node.js, and more.

# Games
## Paddle Effect
A work-in-progress Unity game.

# Software
## [Minecraft Resource Manager](https://github.com/VanillaChai/minecraft-resource-manager)
Built in C# and WPF, MRM is a Minecraft JSON resource manager and data-drive asset generator. Its purpose is to make it easy to manage your assets when developing Minecraft mods, as well as automatically generating these assets using a flexible template system.

# Mods
## [Quality of Rain](https://github.com/VanillaChai/quality-of-rain)
A Unity mod for Risk of Rain 2. It adds a couple of quality of life tweaks that can be toggled on or off.

## [Siltbox](https://github.com/VanillaChai/siltbox/wiki)
A Fabric mod for Minecraft. It adds new blocks, items, features, and QoL tweaks that aim to complement and improve the base game.

# Plugins
## [Mini Golf](https://github.com/VanillaChai/mini-golf)
A Spigot plugin for Minecraft servers. It unsurprisingly lets you play mini golf in Minecraft with your friends. It adds a few custom items: the golf ball, iron, putter, wedge, and golf whistle. The golf ball entity has various unique interactions with a handful of blocks, letting you design and create interesting mini golf courses.

## [Warp Books](https://github.com/VanillaChai/warp-books)
A Spigot plugin for Minecraft servers. It adds a few end-game warp items: the warp page, warp book, and warp banner. Warp pages are one-time use warps that can be bound to a location. Warp books are permanent warps that require warp banners to teleport to. When you right-click a warp banner with a warp book it will save that location in the book, and will let you freely teleport there.

# Libraries
## [CraftLib](https://github.com/VanillaChai/craft-lib)
A crafting library for Spigot plugins. It handles custom items in crafting recipes and ensures custom items cannot be used in regular recipes.

## [ShortUtils](https://github.com/VanillaChai/short-utils)
A small library of convenient utility functions that I frequently use for my Spigot plugins.
